Inkboard is a synced Canvas for people to work together and contribute to a collaborative drawing. Users can log in draw strokes with
custom colors and thickness. Users can also clear the canvas of strokes that they have made. The server will differentiate
which strokes were added by which user and update the database accordingly.
